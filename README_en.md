## 📖 Usage Guide & FAQ

To ensure the program runs stably, please carefully read the following configuration requirements and frequently asked questions before use.

### 1. Pre-use Configuration (Required)

Before starting the automation, please check and confirm the following settings:

*   **Graphics Settings**
    *   **Graphics Filters**: **Disable** all graphics card filters and sharpening effects (e.g., NVIDIA Freestyle, AMD FidelityFX).
    *   **Game Brightness**: Use the **default** in-game brightness.
    *   **UI Scaling**: Use the **default 100%** UI scale.
*   **Resolution**
    *   Recommended to use **1600x900** or other common 16:9 resolutions.
*   **Keybindings**
    *   Please use the game's **default** keybindings.
*   **Third-party Software**
    *   Disable any overlays that display information on the game screen, such as the **framerate counter** from MSI Afterburner.
*   **Window and System State**
    *   **Mouse Interference**: When the game window is in the **foreground**, do not move your mouse, as it will interfere with the program's simulated clicks.
    *   **Window State**: The game window can be in the background but **must not be minimized**.
    *   **System State**: Do not let your computer **turn off the display** or **lock the screen**, as this will interrupt the program.

### 2. Quick Start

1.  Navigate to the level or scene you want to automate.
2.  Click the **"Start"** button in the program's interface.

**Running a routine on a schedule** (Simplified Chinese client only)

1.  In **全自动 → 流程**, click **编辑步骤**. Pick a task and click 添加, and order the steps with 上移 and 下移. Settings changed on the right apply only to that step, not to the task's own settings. Click 保存.
2.  On the **计划任务** (Schedule) page, click **创建任务**, choose **流程**, set the time, and tick **任务完成后自动退出 (-e)** (exit when done).
3.  At that time the program starts itself, opens the game, waits until the game is playable, and runs the steps in order. With auto-exit ticked, it closes the game and the program at the end.

The routine stops without clicking anything, and logs why, if the game asks you to sign in, asks for a restart after an update, or shows an anti-cheat error. So keep the account signed in. As above, the computer must not turn off its display or lock.

### 3. Installing External Logic (Mods)

You can install community-developed external logic modules to extend the program's functionality.

1.  From the program's main interface, click the **"Installation Directory"** button to open the program folder.
2.  Place the downloaded Mod files into the `mod` folder.
3.  Restart the program to load them.

### 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: My character often runs into walls or fails to reach the target location.**

*   **Reason**: The game engine's movement speed is strongly tied to the frame rate (FPS).
*   **Solution**:
    1.  **Adjust Game FPS**: In the game's settings, try setting the frame rate limit to **60 FPS**, **120 FPS**, and **Unlimited** to see which one performs most consistently.
    2.  **Adjust Key Press Duration**: In the settings for the relevant task or Mod, fine-tune the **"Key Press Duration"** parameter.
    3.  **Wait for Official Patches**: This issue may need to be addressed in a future official game update.

**Q2: My installed Mod isn't working or isn't being recognized correctly.**

*   **Reason**: The image assets used for recognition within the Mod may not be compatible with all screen resolutions.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  **Change Resolution**: Try switching to a common resolution like 1920x1080 or 1600x900.
    2.  **Update Assets Manually**: If you are familiar with Mod creation, you can re-capture the necessary screenshots for image recognition at your current resolution.

**Q3: The program gets stuck on the results screen and stops running.**

*   **Reason**: Unintentional mouse movement has likely interfered with the program's image recognition.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Click **"Settings"** in the bottom-left corner of the program.
    2.  Switch to the **"Farming Settings"** tab.
    3.  Check and enable the **"Prevent Mouse Interference"** feature.
